"""Debug helpers, installed into `builtins` when the dev dependencies are available.

Importing this module makes `dbg`, `DBG`, `ic`, `insp` and `wat`/`wats` usable
anywhere without imports, and activates `snoop`. `tests/conftest.py` imports it, so
the helpers are always available in tests; in a script or REPL, opt in explicitly:

    import template_test._debug  # noqa: F401

The package itself deliberately does NOT import this module: mutating `builtins`
is a side effect a library must not impose on its consumers.
