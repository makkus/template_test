# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

- project_name: `template_test`
- project_description: A test project.
- python base module: `template_test`
- documentation: `docs` folder

## Development Commands

This project uses `uv` for dependency management and `just` as a task runner.

### Using just (preferred)
- `just tests` - Run all unit tests
- `just test <pattern>` - Run tests matching a pattern (e.g., `just test test_example`)
- `just typecheck` - Run type checker (pyrefly)
- `just typecheck-ty` - Run the alternative type checker (ty)
- `just lint` - Run ruff linter with auto-fix
- `just format` - Run ruff formatter
- `just build-conda` - Build the conda package locally (requires `pixi`)

### Using uv directly
- `uv run pytest tests -s` - Run all tests
- `uv run pytest tests -s -k <pattern>` - Run tests matching pattern
- `uv run pyrefly check` - Type check
- `uv run ty check` - Type check with ty instead
- `uv run ruff check src . --fix` - Lint with auto-fix
- `uv run ruff format src .` - Format code

## Dependency Management

- Runtime dependencies live in `[project].dependencies`, dev tooling in the `dev` dependency
  group (`uv add <pkg>` / `uv add --dev <pkg>`).
- `uv.lock` is committed. The `uv-lock` pre-commit hook re-locks when `pyproject.toml`
  changes, and CI installs with `uv sync --locked`, so a stale lockfile fails loudly.
- A weekly scheduled workflow (`.github/workflows/dependency-refresh.yaml`) runs
  `uv lock --upgrade`, tests the fresh resolution, and opens a PR with the new lockfile.
  Don't upgrade dependencies by editing the lockfile by hand.


## Conda packaging

A `rattler-build` recipe lives in `conda.recipe/recipe.yaml`; `just build-conda` builds it
locally (needs `pixi` on PATH, since rattler-build is a standalone binary rather than a PyPI
package). CI builds and publishes it to the `freckles` anaconda.org channel.

The recipe packages the wheel from `dist/` rather than building from source, so `uv build` has
to run first -- `just build-conda` does that for you.

**Important:** the recipe cannot read `pyproject.toml`. Whenever `[project].dependencies`
changes, mirror the change into `requirements.run` in `conda.recipe/recipe.yaml`, or the conda
package ships without its dependencies.

## Code Architecture

This package is created from a template project. In case you need to modify something in the generic project setup that would benefit other projects, let me know instead of changing
things in here.

### Package Structure
- Source code: `src/template_test/` (namespace package)
- Tests: `tests/`

### Code Style
- Formatter: ruff (black-compatible, line-length 88)
- Linter: ruff
- Type checker: pyrefly (ty is also installed and configured; see `just typecheck-ty`)
- Docstring convention: Google style

### Debug Utilities
Importing `template_test._debug` installs several debug helpers as builtins (when the
dev dependencies are available). `tests/conftest.py` imports it, so they are always usable in
tests; in a script or REPL, run `import template_test._debug` first. The package
itself never imports it, so consumer imports stay side-effect free.
- `dbg()` - Rich print for debugging
- `DBG()` - devtools debug
- `ic()` - icecream debugger
- `wat` / `wats` - wat inspection tool
- `insp()` - Rich inspect
- `snoop` - Function tracer (auto-installed)

## Test Markers
Tests can be marked with: `slow`, `integration`, `unit`
Example: `uv run pytest tests -m "not slow"`
